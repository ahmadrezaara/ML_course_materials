The Kernel trick is a technique used in such situations. Consider $x$ as your input features with dimension $p$. One can use function $\\phi: R^p â†’ R^d$ to map the input features to another space with dimension $d$. Finding good $\\phi$ such that data points become near linearly separable makes the previous formulation of the problem and its dual useful by replacing $\\phi(x_i)$ for $x_i$ in the problem definition. The function $\\phi(x)$ can even be a mapping to an infinite-dimensional space.\n",
